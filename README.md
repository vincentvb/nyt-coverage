An interactive map that visualizes where the NYTimes has focused its international coverage â€” spanning from 1852-2020.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Node.js >= 16

## Quick Start

```
npm install

npm start
```

## Data Collection

This visualization relies entirely upon data supplied by [NYTime's Archive API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview).

While the data has already been retrieved and saved in the repo as CSV files, you can recreate the data retrieval process as follows:

```
# Register for an NYT Developer API key and follow the instructions found at: https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started

python -r requirements.txt

# The following script will take upwards of 3 hours to run due to API rate limiting constraints. Maybe watch a movie while you wait?

API_KEY={YOUR API KEY HERE} python data_collection/api.py

python data_collection/transform_data.py
